# Candidate Design Reviewer Prompts

Use these prompts only after the full candidate design is coherent. Give both
reviewers the same compact review brief:

- user intent, success criteria, and constraints;
- relevant inspected repository evidence;
- approaches considered and why the candidate was chosen;
- the complete candidate design;
- material technical claims and their known evidence.

Reviewers are read-only. They report findings; they do not rewrite the design.

Both roles are model-independent. Bind them to available routes — a fresh
same-family context and/or the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent — preferring a
different model family for at least one where practical.

## Constructive Review

Dispatch the constructive reviewer with:

```text
Constructively review this candidate design.

Check user-intent alignment, missing requirements or possibilities, important
implications, architectural coherence, simpler or clearer alternatives,
unresolved decisions, and high-level testability.

Do not rewrite the design merely to use different wording. Report only findings
that would materially improve completeness, coherence, practicality, simplicity,
or intent alignment. For each finding, explain its impact and the smallest useful
change.

## Adversarial Review

Dispatch the adversarial reviewer in a fresh, explicitly read-only context
(the `codex:codex-rescue` subagent or another independent route) with:

```text
Adversarially review this candidate design. Do not edit files.

Look specifically for:
1. unsupported assumptions;
2. invented requirements;
3. failure modes and important edge cases;
4. unnecessary complexity;
5. materially simpler alternatives;
6. technical claims requiring verification;
7. contradictions with user intent;
8. dependencies or capabilities assumed without evidence.

Ask: Can this be materially simpler while still fully solving the current
requirement? Do not redesign merely because you prefer another architecture.

Resolve each finding subtractive-first — Delete, Narrow, Simplify, Reuse,
Clarify, and only then Add. A missing capability is a defect only when a
confirmed actor, approved requirement, stated constraint, or observable success
test requires it; do not treat speculative or unconfirmed capability as missing.

Classify each finding as BLOCKER, IMPORTANT, or OPTIONAL. For load-bearing
factual claims where useful, classify them VERIFIED, INFERRED, or UNSUPPORTED.
For every BLOCKER or IMPORTANT finding — especially an additive recommendation —
report: the confirmed requirement affected, the smallest valid correction, the
subtractive option you considered, and why an additive change is necessary if you
propose one. Do not force this format onto OPTIONAL findings.

[REVIEW BRIEF]
```

Where the harness offers a Git-state review command (in Claude Code, the
`/codex:adversarial-review` command reviews Git state), that reviews committed
work; use an in-context subagent route for a candidate design that is not yet
committed. If the adversarial route is absent before dispatch, the SA applies
the same adversarial prompt itself and clearly reports the degraded review.
Apply the same fallback to the constructive prompt when no independent reviewer
route exists.

Capability absence is different from invocation failure. If a reviewer is
available but setup, authentication, dispatch, completion, or result retrieval
fails, report the actionable failure and ask whether to retry or continue with
degraded self-review. Never fabricate or silently replace missing reviewer
output.

## Targeted Re-check

Use at most once per gate. Dispatch only the reviewer whose expertise matches
the unresolved issue:

```text
Re-check one unresolved candidate-design issue. Do not reopen settled findings
or offer unrelated improvements.

Unresolved finding: [BLOCKER OR IMPORTANT FINDING]
Relevant user intent and constraints: [ONLY RELEVANT ITEMS]
Design delta since review: [CHANGED PARTS ONLY]
New evidence: [EVIDENCE OR "NONE"]

Return ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED with a brief evidence-based reason. If a
material factual claim remains uncertain, name exactly what would verify it.
```

If that reviewer is unavailable, the primary agent applies this same scoped
check and discloses the missing independent perspective.
