# The Fix Loop — Full Detail

The loop triggers when the review reports spec ❌, any Critical or Important
finding, or a ⚠️ item you confirmed as a real gap.

Before the loop starts, two routes leave it immediately:

- Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go
  (`Task <N>: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`), and point the final whole-branch
  review at that list so it can triage which must be fixed before merge. A
  roll-up nobody reads is a silent discard. Minor findings never enter the loop.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with what the
  plan's text requires — is the human's decision, like any plan contradiction:
  present the finding and the plan text, ask which governs. Do not dismiss the
  finding because the plan mandates it, and do not dispatch a fix that
  contradicts the plan without asking.

Everything else enters the loop. A fix round is one fix dispatch plus one
scoped re-review. Five rounds maximum per task.

**Rounds 1-3 — resume the original implementer.** Send it the open findings
verbatim. Its context is intact: it knows the task, the code, and its own
choices. If your harness cannot send another message to a live subagent,
dispatch a fresh implementer carrying the brief path, the report-file path, and
the findings — the report file is the persistent memory either way. For the
Codex route's resume flags, see `codex-route.md`.

**Rounds 4-5 — dispatch a fresh implementer on a more capable model** (per
`model-selection.md`), with the brief path, the report-file path, the open
findings, and this framing: "A prior implementer attempted this task [N] times;
you own it now. Read the report file for what was tried." A loop that survives
three resumes usually means the implementer cannot see its own problem — fresh
eyes and a capability bump in one move.

**Every round, either way:** the implementer fixes, re-runs the tests covering
the amended code, appends its fix report to the same report file, and returns
the short contract. Before re-dispatching the reviewer, confirm the fix report
contains the covering tests, the command run, and the output; dispatch the
re-review once all three are present. Name the covering test files in the fix
message — a one-line fix does not need the whole suite. For the Codex route,
repeat the lifecycle gate in `codex-route.md` before each re-review.

**The re-review is scoped.** Run `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE
HEAD` where FIX_BASE is the head the previous review saw, and dispatch
[../re-review-prompt.md](../re-review-prompt.md) with the findings list, the
brief, the report file, and the printed diff path. The re-reviewer verdicts
each finding ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and flags new breakage in the fix diff
only. New Critical/Important breakage in the fix diff joins the open findings
list. Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger as deferred minors — they
never extend the loop.

Record the author type of each fix and apply Independent review routing
(`model-selection.md`) again to the fix diff. Any fresh reviewer receives the
complete re-review prompt. Never let the fix author review its own work.

**After each round,** append to the ledger:
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<X> addressed, <Y> open — <finding one-liners>; commits <a7>..<b7>)`

Never fix findings yourself in the controller session — your context stays
clean for coordination, and controller fixes skip review.

## The breaker

When round 5's re-review still leaves findings open, stop dispatching.
Adjudicate each open finding yourself — you hold the plan and the cross-task
context the reviewer lacks:

- **The reviewer is wrong, or the point is contestable:** park it —
  `Task <N>: parked — <finding> — ruling: <why the code stands>`. The final
  review sees both sides.
- **Real, but nothing downstream builds on it:** park it the same way, with a
  ruling that says it's real and deferred.
- **Real and load-bearing** — a later task builds on it, or it reveals a plan
  defect: STOP. Append `Task <N>: BLOCKED — <reason>` and report to your human
  partner with the finding, the plan text it collides with, and the fix
  history. Parking a structural failure lets every dependent task build on it
  and hands the final review a problem it cannot fix either.

Adjudicate only at the cap. Adjudicating earlier to end a loop is pre-judging
with a different name. Every adjudication is a ledger entry — a silent discard
is forbidden.
